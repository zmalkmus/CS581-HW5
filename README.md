Greedy Algorithms and Network Flow
1. Greedy Algorithms: Write an algorithm in the language of your choice to provide
a Huffman encoding from the contents of a .txt file (just the 26 lower case letters
of the alphabet in some arbitrary combination and length) and apply it to
compress the file. Your program should output 2 things, the frequency table for
the characters, and the size of the file before and after the encoding.
2. Network Flow: Write an algorithm in a language of your choice that takes as input
a flow network in modified DIMACS format and returns all flow augmenting paths.
Ensure infinite looping isnâ€™t possible. I will try to break your code.
Ex. File (tab separated values)

## How to Run
